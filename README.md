# JapaneseGraph
A port of [HanziGraph](https://github.com/mreichhoff/HanziGraph) for Japanese. Even more WIP than HanziGraph.

An early version of the site [is available](https://japanesegraph.com/). 

You can also see [the reddit discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/u5n2xf/learning_kanji_through_the_words_that_connect_them/) or [the discussion on tofugu](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese-learning-resources-database/japanese-graph/) (it also made it onto [their curated list for summer 2022](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/japanese-learning-resources-summer-2022/)).
